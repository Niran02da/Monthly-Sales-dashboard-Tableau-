This dashboard provides a detailed view of sales performance across various metrics, product categories, and time frames. Below is a breakdown of its components:

###  Key Performance Indicators (KPIs):
- Sales: Displays the total sales amount for the selected month, here shown as ₹2,327K (Indian Rupees).
- Profit: Shows the profit generated during the month, ₹292K.
- Average Discount: Represents the average discount offered across products, here 15.5%.
- Quantity: Displays the total number of products sold in the selected month, which is 38,654 units.
### Product Monthly Comparison (Bar Chart):
A side-by-side bar chart comparing product sales between April and May for different sub-categories like Accessories, Appliances, Art, Binders, Bookcases, Chairs, Copiers, etc.
The blue bars represent sales in April, while the orange bars represent sales in May. This allows for a quick comparison of month-over-month performance, showing how each product category has performed across these months.

### Category Contribution (Donut Chart):
A donut chart visualizes the sales contribution from different categories:

- Home Office (18.92%)
This gives an understanding of which customer segments are driving the most revenue in the selected period.
### Daily Sales Trend (Area Chart):
The daily trend chart represents sales trends throughout the month based on order dates.
The area chart shows fluctuations in sales on a day-by-day basis, with peaks and troughs across different days. Both April and May are shown with different colors, enabling month-over-month comparison of daily sales performance.

### Top Customers (Table):
